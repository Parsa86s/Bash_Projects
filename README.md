A Bash script to organize files in a directory based on their extensions. This script first counts the files in the specified directory, then organizes them into subdirectories named after their file extensions. After organizing the files, it prompts the user to confirm whether they want to keep the organized structure. If the user decides not to keep it, the script will revert the organization and restore the original file arrangement.

Features:

Prompts the user for the directory path.
Counts the files in the specified directory.
Organizes files into subdirectories based on their extensions.
Provides user confirmation to keep or revert changes.
Ensures created directories have appropriate permissions for user access.
Usage:

Run the script: ./file_organizer.sh
Enter the path to the directory you want to organize.
Confirm if you want to keep the files organized or revert changes.
This script helps in managing and organizing files by their types, making it easier to locate and handle files based on their extensions.
